## What makes it? 

**In a word - _development_, in four -**

These are **external** - optional and not, minor to strong, constructive and devastating (also neutral) - forces, factors, and drives. 

Which, culturally speaking, mix, tint, blur, or shade (if not wash off) the four paints. 

Initiative and funding render the canvas. Math/logic and artistic skills, domain expertise, and creativity prop the picture.

**_Coding_**, **_development_**, **_design_**, and **_architecture_** are tied, overlapping, and time-unordered role-driven processes.

Many projects' modest size and lifetime will shrink them almost to rectangular, ...

 Axes of e**X**pansion and complexit**Y** will tear this patchwork - not a figure of speech. It is not about megastructures (like OSs, IDEs, gaming engines) and IT prizewinners but challenges beyond the ordinary (LOB, CAD).

Resource scaling against "horizontal" growth of design will raise a kludge - horribly coupled, getting harder and more expensive to evolve and maintain, with no rational heritage but how not to do it.

Stacking design decisions to the model heap against towering abstractions will make chaos (inherent to any software dev) unmanageable at a certain height.

To distinguish our survey (at least for file system) i couldn't find a better tag but a mocking acronym Arc&nbsp;Deco<sup>🎨</sup> (**Arc**itecture **De**sign d**E**velopnent **Co**ding).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🎨</sup> <sub>Homonym to Arc&nbsp;Deco - [Arts décoratifs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Deco) `är(t)-dā-ˈkō`</sub>

That's so much to share that can only stop here with the ToC:\

|- Architecture and architector\
