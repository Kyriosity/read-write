## Categorization

Categorization (classification) is much more profound than breaking collocations and sentences and building the folder hierarchy. &mdash; 
It makes the structural frame of sound abstractions.

People manage to categorize boulders in the Oort cloud and catalogize paltry insects, and it must not be a slight challenge for unique by-nature software entities. 
Nevertheless, you will meet shallow folders and huge lists in many GitHub projects. 

> **Rule of palm &mdash; four fingers (or less) will hide the folder content on the screen.**

### Tags

The only limitation of categorization is the strict tree hierarchy.

## How to name...

### as usual

The prevalent naming is a derivative of the development, which

❌ rests on programmable "false-domain" with `Helper.Get(..)`, `Utils.Do(...)`, `Service.Find(...)`, and other supports,\
❌ leaves "construction waste" of temporary names, placeholders,\
❌ spreads umbrella terms and horizontally swelling folders,\
❌ spawns long names and shallow categories (`AddTableReservationInRestaurant(..)`),\
❌ interferes with existing domain and programming naming,\
❌ contains jargon and slang.

### as crucial

The naming of libraries, packages (assemblies), folders, classes, methods/functions, and even non-public _vars_ must be a **№1** challenge and involve the whole team<sup>:family:</sup> in discussions. 

The inevitable and heavy expenses will pay off with the formation of ***lingua franca*** throughout the team and project, and ...
  
+ shared comprehension of a domain, collaboration, and indeed bound team,
+ genuine design and self-descriptive code,
+ inspiration for behavior/domain-driven design,
+ base for writing and reading the documentation<sup>📒</sup>,
+ less tension to get into a project for newcomers,
+ comfy navigation in the source code (beginning from <kbd>CTRL+F</kbd>).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:family:</sup><sub> The team means not only developers and managers but customers, testers with end users.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>📒</sup><sub> reqs/specs, DoU, meetings protocols, and primers - hard to follow but easy to misunderstand or forget</sub>

It's an ingredient of successful [domain-driven design](../drive/README.md#Domain-drive) (and vice versa).

## Wrapping up

+ Even top consonant teams under time pressure and brakes on perfectionism would rarely be proud of their naming implementation. 
+ The naming (as [code quality](../../QA/README+/code-quality.md)) will never be perfect, but efforts to improve them must be honest and continuous.

## Hall of fame

🥇 Core S[E]QL commands.\
🏆 _Bread crumbling_ for navigation - both the idea and name selection win

Audience choice Price goes to Mrs. [Grace Hopper](../../../../pencraft/README+/quotes/README+/contributors/README.md#Grace-Hopper) 
who suggested tongue (English) semantics for programming (so natural now that one can't estimate).

## Legacy

🚧 ... to list ... 🚧

## World of ambiguity

### "Generals"

As programming evolved the mass of general terms must have been given. Some, as `object` or `bug`, are relatively univocal hits &mdash; others shade higher level notion or interfere with them:

Application, solution, interface, exception - to name a few.

### Bug or Fix?

What's project management software names _bug_ is its _fix_.

### <samp>Exception</samp> or Error ?

Many languages (including C#) use this term for errors to throw so its meaning can sound even opposite - allowance.


## Curtain of grace (opened)

👑 And the winner is ... `dirty` in miscellaneous languages and APIs as the trait of a modified object.

'Emoji' defines pictograms overall while being only their subset. 
"Icons" is .. eh .. a bit blasphemous.

🗼"Tower of Babel" award for naming in different alphabets. (Unless it's a highly localized domain or business.)
