# Software - Quality Assurance

When there's no more room in code,\
the bugs will walk the Earth.

Software is error-prone by its nature.
AS IT... AS IS

## Test by nature

The developer is the first tester

The cases when the submitted code is a bug by itself (i've seen such)

## Automated tests

Tests are optional but highly recommended and a natural share of software development. Be it driven design or anti-bug coverage.
