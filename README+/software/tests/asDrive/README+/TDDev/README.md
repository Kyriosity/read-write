# Test Driven DEVELOPMENT &mdash; Reminder

🚧🚧🚧 PLACEHOLDER 🚧🚧🚧

The purpose of TDD is in no way test automation but means to:

Optionally and cautionary:
+ start a **test framework** of the project (TDD will then outline test coverage with start stuff written in a good black-box manner).

MULTIFEED DRIVE


+ promptly find tests and appreciate their naming and categorization,
+ learn the application by viewing and running tests.

Project "**masters**" shall

+ begin any addition, change, and **removal** change with tests,

### Downsides of TDD

it was so much test-driven flattery that some criticism must take place. The most negative influence could be _voodoo programming_ to achieve specific results.

Others are:

- ever-growing lines of non-production code, which require refactoring and maintenance lesser but comparable to main projects,
- lack (if not absence) of ripe active frameworks. // 🚧 ToDo: use-dev links to "3D tests"


## Wrap up

It's not enough to write legible and effective tests, which nobody will be eager to explore unless they get unfathomably scarlet.
