# Rationale

<details><summary><ins>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A metaphor you may skip&nbsp;</ins>&nbsp;...</summary>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... but (thanks) you've clicked.

<p dir="rtl">A cherry-picked <b>metaphor</b><br />.simplifies explanation<br />(.At times even for readers)</p>

<table><tr valign="top"><td><p><b>Figure of chess is a universal figure of speech...</b><sup>♟️</sup></p>

Win - Breaking changes go light.

Checked - principal changes are done with Woodoo programming.

Stalemate - the project works, but big features can hardly be added.

Mate - dev stops only support. The time to give it away to another team and speak about a remake on other technologies.
  
</td><td>
<p>♕♛ Learning elementary programming and the rules of the checkered strategy are both fast, enjoyable, and attainable for the masses. 
Starting programming resembles games of neophytes: <i>blitz</i> (wins follow fails), fun, and visibly improving.</p>

<p>♖♜ Understanding and learning principles and check patterns will prevent blunders, but not positional traps of better opponents.<br />
In like manner, a keen junior will soon write good pieces of code but shaky solutions.</p>

<p>♗♝ Chess openings rest on studied, memorized decisions and strong theory. In software, it means IT education, selection of platforms, frameworks, and external parts, when experimentation and creativity are abnormal</p>

<p>♘♞ Then the perception of combinatory vastness and the need to think in several moves lifts the curtain of first naive impressions.<br />
There are only three "moves" in programming: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` over bits, but they provide even the bigger than <code><b>&gt;</b>&thinsp;8x8</code> space for fantasies and alternative solutions.</p>

<p>Passion wouldn't be enough to rise much higher &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; learning and understanding of theory become essential along with games against stronger opponents. &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;
The number of games or written applications won't break the ceiling.<sup>👑</sup></p>
  
<p>In chess, theoretical roadmaps and schools lead to higher ratings, ruthlessly showing one's place. <b>Here, the metaphor breaks down.</b> 
Software ways to craftsmanship are inscrutable and assessed by eye.</p>

These two are paved with miscellaneous dilemmas, but one pivotal:

<h3 align="center"><b><samp>Why don't best development practices make great design by themselves?&thinsp;</b><br />
<sub>(Developing excellent features, feeling the patterns and principles, and writing <a href="../../../QA/README+/code-quality.md">quality code</a>, 
  <br />but expectations end up with achieving just a passable project state.)</sub></h3>

Now veneer them with <ins>rhetorical</ins> vs. <ins>open</ins> <kbd>&thinsp;<samp><b>I&thinsp;S</b></samp>&thinsp;</kbd>, <kbd>&thinsp;<samp><b>W&thinsp;H&thinsp;Y</b></samp>&thinsp;</kbd>, and <kbd>&thinsp;<samp><b>H&thinsp;O&thinsp;W</b></samp>&thinsp;</kbd> tiles:

* Is there something supernatural in system design compared to project development?
* Why is experience rather an inhibitor of rapid development?
* How can the code obfuscate lucid domain logic for reviewers?
* Why don't bright architectural ideas propagate to development?
* Why is getting into big projects a headache and dread?
* Why does adapting external solutions require excessive work?
* Why don't many good design decisions survive, and how do bad ones rematerialize in the next endeavors?
* Why are developers doomed to repeat decisions and solutions done by others?
* Why do frankly bad parts of dark code nonetheless fuse to enterprise architecture that works and persists for years?
* Why could a harmless syntax sugar be delayed for releases as a _breaking change_? 
* How smart leads pass between evolutionary kludges and "conceptualism" utopia.

And the answer to many <kbd>why</kbd> isn't always or principally a bad design state.

**More (de)motivation:**
  
Successful projects from the neighboring materiality, less patchable and less reversible but much more fragile, may both hearten or intimidate:\
Liquefied gas tankers, skyscrapers, airplane auto-navigation, implants, space telescopes, robotic lines ...

And these are your peers with different backgrounds who created them. «Not gods fired these pots.»

## Goal

Bridge development to design.
This requires **abstraction of** software **abstractionism** but with utilitarian intentions: detecting what helps and harms in mundane code (that is, answers the <samp><i>WHY</i></samp>s and <samp><i>HOW</i></samp>s above).

### Objectives

* Keep software as a whole continuous "application" of pieces of IT theory and practical decisions, rather than tailored scattered occasional craft, or the building of sand castles on greenfields, or the _Grand Art_ of perfectionism.
* Classify parts, activities, and roles.
* Think over "rails" and the burden of previous experience.
* Eliminate the fear of "high" design decisions.

## What's next

We can't paint <sub><picture><img alt="&thinsp;Arc&nbsp;Deco" src="../../../../_rsc/_img/ArcDeco/ArcDeco-bar-14px_rounded.png" /></picture></sub> from the first cast but let's roll up our sleeves, take a brush, and with shy strokes put layer after layer on the canvas of software abstractionism...

> 👆 **Now it's only the <samp><ins><span title="Applying layers to create a barrier between the canvas and the paint.">PRIMING</span></ins></samp>.**
