# Software

## What makes it? 

### **In a word - `programming`, in four -**

<sup>:de:</sup> <sub>Inspired by informal interpretation of the German flag: from the **dark** past through the bloody present to the <mark>golden</mark> future.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Since `4>3` tearful blue was inserted for Design.)</sub>

Which, culturally speaking, mix, tint, blur, or <br />shade (if not wash off) the four paints.<br />

Initiative and funding render the canvas. <br />
Abstraction/math/logic and artistic skills, <br />domain expertise, and creativity prop the picture.

## Wrapping, ...

**_Coding_**, **_development_**, **_design_**, and **_architecture_** are tied, overlapping, and loosely-ordered role-driven processes.

Many projects' modest size lifetime with banality and, in particular, isolated work on them will shrink the pie to a bar, ... ⬇️\

### ... but ...

Axes of e**X**pansion and complexit**Y** may tear this patchwork.

**X**: Coercive resource scaling against "horizontal" growth will add to a horrific pile.\
(getting harder and more expensive to evolve and maintain, with little rational heritage except how not to do tips)

**Y**: With stacking up design decisions (as they come) this pile will begin to fall to pieces at a certain height of abstraction.\
(That is, the chaos, inherent to any programming, will become unmanageable.) 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🙋</sup> <sub>This said not about megastructures and prize-winning brainteasers (like OS, DBMS, IDE, or gaming engines) but challenges beyond the ordinary:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new LOB foundation, unfamiliar domains (such as CAD or interpreters), or remakes (original graph base, making async from legacy and dividing modules).</sub>

Such menaces encourage us to verbalize the metaphysics of software. 

To distinguish the survey following (at least for the file system) I couldn't find a better tag but a mocking acronym -

(<mark><b>Arc</b></mark>itecture <mark><b>D</b></mark>esign D<mark><b>e</b></mark>velopment <mark><b>Co</b></mark>ding).<sup>🎨</sup>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🎨</sup> <sub>Homonym to Arc&nbsp;Deco - [Arts décoratifs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Deco). Its introduction a century ago (1925) appeals to make `är-dā-ˈkō` great again [mockery again].</sub>
