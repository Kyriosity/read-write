# Software

## What makes it? 

### **In a word - `programming`, in four -**

Initiative and funding prime the canvas. <br />
Abstraction/math/logic and artistic skills, <br />domain expertise, and creativity prop the picture.

**_Coding_**, **_development_**, **_design_**, and **_architecture_** are tied, overlapping, and loosely-ordered role-driven processes.

Axes of e**X**pansion and complexit**Y** may tear this patchwork:<sup>🙋</sup>

&harr;&nbsp;**X**: Coercive resource scaling against "horizontal" growth will add to a horrific pile.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(getting harder and more expensive to evolve and maintain, with little rational heritage except "how not to do" tips)

&varr;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Y**: With stacking up design decisions (as they come) this pile will begin to fall to pieces at a certain height of abstraction.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(That is, the chaos, inherent to any programming, will become unmanageable.) 

Such menaces encourage us to verbalize the metaphysics of software.
