# `C#` &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; Features and Parts in shade

Different from [underused sides](../cs-feat_underused.md), these shaded parts (good or not) are specific, and a developer may never need to use one. However, one must be aware of them to use on demand or compare with a custom realization.

## ReactiveX

Ironically, it was Microsoft who originated [ReactiveX](https://reactivex.io/)<sup>🔗</sup> but its fame was established through platforms of others, e.g., Angular.

[IObservable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iobservable-1)<sup>🪟</sup> is in base classes, [Reactive extensions](https://github.com/dotnet/reactive)<sup>:octocat:</sup> are at least a decade in .NET and properly integrated with LINQ, but ... seldom used.\
Sure, event/stream-based development isn't for every use, and its paradigm requires some learning curve, but this isn't an excuse not to look in `System.Reactive.Linq`.

### Use cases

* Messaging. In evolved scenarios, you may like to group messages or give a grace period to revoke one.
* Hardware. Dealing with APIs, you may deal with physical effects and remedies (e.g., bouncing switches).

## Extensions properties - C#14❗

Now they are available as a preview.

```csharp
public static class NameDoesNotMatter
{
    extension(string test)
    {
        public string Test => test; 
}
```
