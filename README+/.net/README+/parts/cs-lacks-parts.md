# `C#` &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; <samp>Nice to have</samp> &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; Parts and Frameworks

Along with [nice-to-have syntax/features](../cs-lacks.md) there are some bigger blocks of _ideational_ `C#`.

## Testing

Tests for drive or coverage are optional but a natural part of development. The three most popular frameworks for .NET (NUnit, xUnit, MSTest) have pros and cons, but none is state-of-the-art.

Besides weak points (like bulky names), there are lacks:

- no support for dynamic test data,
- no way to auto-test code that must not compile (e.g., to exclude the wrong branches of building calls) ➡️ [semantic posers](https://github.com/Kyriosity/use-dev/blob/main/README+/tests/README+/prog_tests-semantics.md),
- no gradual asserts ➡️ [discussion of workaround](https://github.com/Kyriosity/use-dev/tree/main/README+/tests/README+/unit_test-gradual_assert.md),
- only a single data source ➡️ [multi-feed workaround](https://github.com/Kyriosity/use-dev/tree/main/README+/tests/README+/prog_tests-cut_feeds.md).

## Math

Native [`Math`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.math)<sup>🪟</sup> is pretty scarce, and neither 3d-party library is modern or all-around.

<b>C#</b> would only profit from a lightweight assembly that could: 

+ inventory more [constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_constant)<sup><b>w</b></sup>,
+ provide more useful functions (there are myriads uncovered),
+ approximate popular irrational values like π (Pi) to the requested length,
+ generate and check numbers in [sequences](http://oeis.org/wiki/Welcome)<sup>🔗</sup> (`bool Prime.Has(ulong num)`), detect sequences,
+ introduce complex numbers,
+ parallelize, async heavy algorithms with progress report and cancellation option

## Dates

Rudimentary `DateTime` and `DateOnly` are not intuitive (e.g. `new DateTime(1999, 9, 1, 9, 5, 6, 7)`), rather constrained (e.g. no BCE years), and inflexible. 
Built-in calendars render limited expansion.

➡️ [AbcChrono](https://github.com/Kyriosity/use-dev/tree/main/README+/parts/AbcChrono) in the _use-dev_ repo extends data handling (e.g. to origin from Bing Bang).

## Measurement systems

Definition of natural values (geometry, masses, temperature, electricity, movement _u.a._) and their conversions between systems of measurements (metric, US customary, UK imperial _u.a._) are more than essential tools (e.g., Celsius-Fahrenheit-Kelvin).

The approach for such is proposed in [C# Multifaceted-Value](https://github.com/Kyriosity/use-dev/tree/6ab68c7af589d37715c171e61dc51d0b5a208c73/README+/projects/U-Val)<sup>➡️</sup>.

## Lingua

Let's take some output from fictitious tree search `$"Branches: {found}, ≥ leaves: {cutoff}"`. That can be quickly refactored for a narrative or voice generator:\
`$"{found} {(1 == found ? "branch has" : "branches have")} no less than {cutoff} {(1 == cutoff ? "leaf" : "leaves")}"`

If an application generates a lot of multilingual text, it won't be a big deal to implement

<details>
<summary><ins>&nbsp;Blueprint of pluralization utility&nbsp;</ins></summary>

```csharp
namespace Lingua.Grammar;

interface INumbered
{
    string Count(long num);
    string Count(double num);
}

interface IPluralForms {
    INumbered Plural((string singular, string plural) forms, string culture = "");
    INumbered Dual((string singular, string dual, string plural) forms, string culture = "");
    INumbered Trial((string singular, string dual, string trial, string plural) forms, string culture = "");
    INumbered Paucal((string singular, string paucal, string plural) forms, string culture = "");
    INumbered Custom(string[] forms, Func<long, int> indexWhole, Func<double, int>? indexFractional = null);
}
```

</details>

However,
- This reinvents the wheel,
- There are other forms of grammatical numbers besides plurals,
- Numbering is only a part of grammatical agreements in every single tongue,
- Linguistics requires competence in more than a pair of language families.

And what if .NET foundation classes could:
- neatly formulate declensions, conjugations, and other formations,
- define constants for unfamiliar forms of loanwords (Greek and Latin _u.a._),
- revise habitual [`CultureInfo`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.globalization.cultureinfo)<sup>🪟</sup> (classify tongue families and default agreements)

And, not least, add syntax sugar like

<details>
<summary><ins>&nbsp;<b>Proposal for grammar interpolation</b>&nbsp;</ins></summary>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;`${number [: [format] : [forms] : []] }`, where

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*number* is whole or fractional subject\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*format* specifies usual format or to put in words\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*forms* - grammar forms as in imaginary `INumbered` in the snippet above

### Classification and attributes

The custom _use-dev_  ➡️ [⭐ISie⭐](https://github.com/Kyriosity/use-dev/blob/main/README+/parts/_ext/ISie/README.md) demanded me to make fast [AbcLingua](https://github.com/Kyriosity/use-dev/blob/main/src/TuttiFrutti/Abc/Lingua) folders. But I'd rather find such a structure in C# language or frameworks.
