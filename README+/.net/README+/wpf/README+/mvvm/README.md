# MVVM _and_ WPF

Model-View-ViewModel (_abbr_. MVVM) is a well-accepted, easy, powerful concept of __separation of concerns__, also known as [MVP](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html)<sup>🔗</sup>.

WinForms application can be an exemplary MVVM<sup>🔧</sup>, but it was WPF that formed a symbiosis with MVVM and made the latter mainstream (and not only in WPF). 
Notably successful and stable Microsoft Visual Studio&nbsp;2010 was written from scratch in WPF, relying on MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel).

&nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>🔧</sup>&nbsp;<samp>In fact, WPF is based on Winform's [`Binding`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.binding)<sup>🪟</sup>.</samp>

## Structure

|- __Model__  - any common or tailored [application model](../../../../../software/design/parts/README+/app-model.md)\
&nbsp; // Model classes must be frontend agnostic but virtual (open) for adapting in presentation (e.g., `virtual` props and methods.\
|- [__ViewModel__](README+/wpf_mvvm-viewmodel.md)\
|- [XAML view](../wpf-xaml_view.md) *

&nbsp; &nbsp; * It can also be any other kind of [application view](../../../../../software/design/parts/README+/app-view.md) bound with the ViewModel

## Sample

An MVVM application may grow into an enterprise solution, but from the ground up, its sketch claims a mere few minutes<sup>:arrow_down:</sup>

For greater applications, you may select between commercial frameworks and freeware templates. For prototypes and learning, you may begin with your tailor-made solutions.

## Drawbacks and lacks

Let me stress once again that MVVM is not a template but a concept. It got WPF implementations from open source communities (e.g., Prism), big provider names, and private initiatives, but neither has achieved the status of a "built-in" feature.

Alas, there are not too many popular and interchangeable pluggable "bricks" to build effective WPF-MVVM (that is, no common specification). There's no thesis on dynamic MVP resting on tasks, not obsolete static models.

## Wrapping up

MVVM has been widely established, but is neither a universal nor a golden section. On the call of peculiarity or creativity, any other, even monolithic, form is legal.&nbsp;<sup>:triangular_ruler:</sup>\
