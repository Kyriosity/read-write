<h1 align="center">Heavily biased about <code>C#</code></h1>

This main .NET language deserves to be noted as one of the most eloquent and all-around languages/platforms for systems and applications. It's a Microsoft flagship (enough said<sup>⛵</sup>), where the ship is .NET and the flag is **`C#`**.

It evolves nonstop, providing us with state-of-the-art, concise, comprehensible syntax, and incredible features ([LINQ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2321724/where-can-i-get-a-good-concise-linq-cheatsheet)<sup>🔗</sup>, [TPL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/task-parallel-library-tpl)<sup>🪟</sup>, [Rx.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/reactive)<sup>:octocat:</sup> i.a.). 

Its dedicated team<sup>:people_holding_hands:</sup> learns from the drawbacks and advantages of other languages, own [community](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/tree/main/proposals)<sup>:octocat:</sup>, and looks up trade-offs between readability and brevity.

**`C#`** allows developers to focus on [code quality](../software/QA/README+/code-quality.md), which .NET will care to compile into effective and safe executables.<sup>💾</sup>  The cleaner the code, the better the performance.<sup>🪩</sup>

Nonetheless, **`C#`** offers "lower-level" _unsafe_ syntax, optimized collections, concurrent structures, and memory spans for specific boosts, intensive tasks, and parallel calculations.

Besides new features, each annual release improves the performance of significant parts. Learning resources are best-of-the-breed for newcomers and skilled with IDEs free for educational and personal use.<sup>⌨️</sup>

Surprisingly **`C#`** is widely utilized in APIs and drivers to industry-standard **embedded** software (_i.a._ automotive and machinery) and **game dev** (popular [Unity engine](https://unity.com/solutions/programming)<sup>🔗</sup>).

With all the praise given, **`C#`** isn't monumentally accomplished and has its foibles and lacks (my critics, wishlists, and ideas—in the subfolders below and near).

## Epilogue

Genuine `C++` or `Perl` experts are legitimate in branding `C#` as "just another _Basic_" while others will argue that it harnesses design phantasies for the sake of dev progress and clarity.
