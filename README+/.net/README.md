# Heavily biased about `C#`

**C#** on .NET deserves to be noted as one of the most eloquent and all-around languages/platforms for systems and applications. It's a Microsoft flagship (enough said<sup>⛵</sup>), where the ship is .NET and the flag is C#.<sup>🙋</sup>

It evolves nonstop, providing us with state-of-the-art, concise, comprehensible syntax, and incredible features ([LINQ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2321724/where-can-i-get-a-good-concise-linq-cheatsheet)<sup>🔗</sup>, [TPL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/task-parallel-library-tpl)<sup>:microsoft:</sup>, [Rx.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/reactive)<sup>🔗</sup> i.a.).

Its dedicated team<sup>:people_holding_hands:</sup> learns from the drawbacks and advantages of other languages, own [community](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/tree/main/proposals)<sup>:octocat:</sup>, and looks up trade-offs between readability and brevity.

C# allows developers to focus on [code quality](../software/QA/README+/code-quality.md), which .NET will care to compile into effective and safe executables.<sup>💾</sup>  The cleaner the code - the better performance.

("lower-level" syntax is also available for specific boosts). For intensive tasks, developers may choose between optimized collections (concurrent, pool, spans).

Each annual release, besides new features, significantly improves the performance of major parts.

Surprisingly `C#` is widely utilized in APIs and drivers to industry-standard **embedded** software (i.a. automotive and machinery) and **game dev** (popular [Unity engine](https://unity.com/solutions/programming)<sup>🔗</sup>).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:⛵:</sup> <sub>Microsoft has neither acquired it (akin to Java) nor outsourced (it could be Python) but FORMED a team to RISE the full megastructure.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🙋</sup>&nbsp;<sub>Genuine C++ experts are justified to name C# "just another Basic" while others will argue that it harnesses design phantasies for the sake of dev progress and clarity.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:people_holding_hands:</sup> <sub>Where you know top figures by name and can follow them on Git, media, and social networks.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>💾</sup> <sub>Now you can avoid selecting a processor, [memory models](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20200728-00/?p=104012)<sup>🔗</sup> and turning off 1MB of RAM to get performance bonus on release.</sub>
