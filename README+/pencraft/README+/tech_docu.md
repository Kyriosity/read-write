# Technical documentation

## Sources

Before writing from the ground up, I would search and try to adapt the following materials, if there exist:

### Similar writing

Any previous version, description of a similar product, or freeware templates. 

Reading other works may inspire but not for plagiarism.

### Requirements

Writing and maintaining requirements must concern project management, and you can use the result. Albeit there could be none in epistolary form.

### Tracking, versioning systems

A tracking system may collect and generate documentation with a pleasant degree of automation.

## Some guidelines to contribute

* First and foremost, the less docu covers essentials the better for all (unless the subject deserves its own wiki). 
* Begin with mindmaps but then apply methodologies to writing (structure, plan, and timeline).
* **Last but not least**, if you write regularly, contribute to content management tools and templates to facilitate further work for you and others.
