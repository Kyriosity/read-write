In my spoiled and biased opinion, there are no pure _software architects_ while architecture artifacts rest on collective development.

## Rationale

The Hellenic term "Architecture" was borrowed from the building, which differs much from the software.

* static vs dynamic
* versatile vs strict

Architecture, opposite to design, must be a platform-independent<sup>🎈</sup> abstraction which nevertheless must grow from the practical development.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🎈</sup> <sub>SQL vs OOD vs impedance</sub>

### Roles falsely granted as the architect

* team/project lead/manager
* lead/senior dev
* librarian
+ computer scientist
+ one who boils down requirements or/and makes sw docu
+ a lucky guy who may draw great diagrams, which are very loose coupled to actual software
