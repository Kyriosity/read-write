[![... then IT must be a waterfall.](../_rsc/_img/memes/ITLearnWaterfall_horiz.png)](../../../software/)

The grains of truth in this wisdom:

* No other knowledge erodes so quickly as the IT tech stack - languages/scripts, markup, frameworks, and their IDEs, UX styles emerge, submerge, and mutate with the year's pace.<sup>:violin:</sup>
* In the orthogonal  (to time) dimension a developer can't stick to a favorite syntax and must be fluent in a wide techno spectrum.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:violin:</sup> <sub>Javascript/HTML, which one learned in 2000, remains only as basic syntax. It went through numerous libs, polyfills, jQuery, and other cool tools and at the moment transformed into single-page frameworks, which rule the web dev.</sub>

**Escape?**

> Don't swim against the current. Stay in the river, become the river; and the river is already going to the sea. This is the great teaching.\
— Rajneesh, aka Osho (1931-1990)

Translated east-to-west this means: find a sinecure in a big company.

Justified, ability in exact sciences is no longer a prerequisite for applied programming. It's right to find a sorting algorithm implementation rather than to write one own.

P.S. I swear that concocting this collage I was unaware of _Hubert Dreyfus_'s "Alchemy and AI", 1965.

## PART II. Seasoned quotes

<details>
<summary><ins>&nbsp;<b>Immanuel Kant for domain-driven design</b>&nbsp;</ins></summary>
&nbsp;

![Kant quote](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dare_to-think!-scarlet)

> The only **objects** of practical reason are therefore those of good and evil.\
For by the former is meant an object necessarily desired according to a principle of reason;\ 
by the latter one necessarily shunned, also according to a principle of reason.

Take it not as mockery but as a small tribute to the 300th birthday of the philosopher considered one of the greatest.

> Where a calculator like ENIAC today is equipped with 18'000 vacuum tubes and weighs 30 tons, **computers in the future may** have only 1'000 vacuum tubes and perhaps **weigh only 1½ tons**.\
_Popular Mechanics, March 1949_

And they were right. The same magazines over seven decades later: "Fully transistorized computer, the IBM 608, hit the market in late 1957. It weighed 1.2 tons."

_computer scientist, known i.a. for Dijkstra's algorithm._

Not only the East grant us great and eloquent teaching ...
