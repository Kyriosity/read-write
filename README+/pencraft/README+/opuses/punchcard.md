## Intramural experience - short and vintage

It was long after the punch decline and the last year they were legacy coursework at my university. I guess because the supply of this carton product became extinct.

### The Task

It was an exercise in PL/I&nbsp;<sup>1️⃣</sup> - present a curve of an assigned function (some $`ax^2 + bx + c`$ was mine). Using teletype symbols to print 2D X-Y graph.

### Carton in, paper out

It looks bizarre in this day and age what barely agile steps it took:

&nbsp;&nbsp;**1️⃣** Think over the _programme_ and sketch it in the dedicated notebook (the paper one).\
&nbsp;&nbsp;**2️⃣** Fill in a lined paper form with procedural statements. (I wonder how this would be object-oriented.)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;**3️⃣** Submit this papyrus to the punching shop - where good ladies were used to decypher student scribble.<sup>🖐️</sup>\
... 🌙 one day after ⛅ ...\
&nbsp;&nbsp;**4️⃣** Fetch a deck of punched paperboard.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;**5️⃣** Bring it to the _computing center_ (one who saw mainframes would advocate the name).\
... 🌙 one/two days after ⛅ ...\
&nbsp;&nbsp;**6️⃣** Pick the medieval scroll in the "print" dprt.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;**7️⃣**  Search for a graph there among collateral outputs.\
If fail, read errors, debug (mentally), and go to step&nbsp;(2).

The motivation was so high (as you can see) that most had succeeded in the first approach but not me. Between (4) and (5) a fellow disciple intruded: shuffling my deck unnoticed. A lesson learned about data security.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1️⃣</sup>&nbsp;<sub>[Programming Language One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/I)<sup>🔗</sup> - perhaps the best name IBM reserved.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🖐️</sup> <sub>One can definitely treat their occupation as true coders.</sub>

## Afterword

My humble story was only a reminder of this great medium. Despite its fast decadence, the punchcard can be titled the best of all times by a superposition of pros and cons. 

Endurance

Mechanical, electromagnetically

Eco-friendly and highly utilizable. Bookmarks and other domestic uses

Enough crypto to proof of work punch

Mini/micro ? OOP/OOD

Ecology

 resistance (electromagnetic)
