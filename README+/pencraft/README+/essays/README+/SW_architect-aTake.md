<p>The essence of architecture appeared as folks managed to erect anything more extravagant and durable than a hut of piled branches.

<p>Ages passed till the art of immobile methodized and acknowledged architects as a detached trade &mdash; 
refined craftsmen exempt from routines and narrow-profile burdens to focus on vision, design, blueprints, and aesthetics.</p>

## Software vs. Building

The architecture of construction and software have much in common. Both demand creativity and grant huge room for phantasy and missteps but must deliver functional wholes in a short while rather than aesthetic values.

Both take advantage of the plethora of tools, techniques, and skills. Both must accumulate mainstream and alternate practices and reveal patterns.

Lack of proficient abstraction work and planning can make both a mess which products loudly crash. Both can be grounds for hollow promises and sandcastles.

Both can't rely solely on generations of experience and a single mastermind but on a team and a hierarchy of experts.

### Diffs are bigger...

 <sup>🐦‍⬛</sup>[unleashed under the wandering circus tent]</p>

Buildings are static, conservative, and traditional &mdash; software is fluid, experimental, and without neoclassicism. Constructions are embossed with materials &mdash; software abstracts from pure boolean logic (without relay, transistor, or warm lamp vibes).

Software is the most automated production where copying, scaling, and installation are clickable. The lifecycle of construction is much longer while decades are an exclusive case of mainframe programs.

Software development gives freedom of full-scale trial and error unthinkable in other productive areas.

A chief, who can stir concrete better than workers, is up and there on the spot to help lay bricks and blocks, knows the mechanics of materials, can operate excavators and cranes like a pro, looks up for cracks, must be a fantastic creature but not in software teams of _Jacks of all trades_.

The classical figure of the architect looks QUESTIONNABLE in SW.

## Into thin air ...

<p dir=rtl><mark>"<b>.I am the Architect</b>"</mark><br />🎦&nbsp;<i>The Architect</i><br/>Dr. Freud looking character)<br/>(of <i>The Matrix Reloaded</i></p>

*Software architecture*, whatever it means, is formalizable and veritable as a product, but not as an exercise. 

**Let me explain such a take.**  There's no intention to defame _software architects_ but to qualify the term as an honor rather than a job title for a bunch of avant practices with practical backup.

This said the software is least suitable for pure architects. 


A determined person or board in high-pro fixed teams may rely on communication BUT ...

THE MATRIX ARCHITECT is the most fictional figure for software.

### Dissonance

Reputable software providers hire _architects_, and they are the central figures at many IT events, there's certification after all.
The team of C#.NET, which is the cnterfold of my dev, speaks about architects....

First and above all, *software architect* sounds cool and distinguishes one from the crowd of developers<sup></sup>. Not that than _mastermind_, and more serious than _dev lord_, that it means. FOR CLIENTS its

<sub>Much profanated DEVeloper where everybody is senior</sub>

Then the title expresses a path of enlightenment of one unchained from the keyboard to draw beautiful top diagrams freed of the digging within dusty codes. 

It's often an alias for roles and duties:

* _domain expert_ or _business analyst_, who boils down requirements to systematic description,
* _team lead_ or _project manager_,
* _lead_/_senior developer_,
* _consultant_, extrapolating known solutions to other adaptations,
* _tutor_, or _technology evangelist_, proposing blueprints for the solution,
* "*librarian-navigator*", somebody with the utmost knowledge of the project,
* geeks from _computer science_.

## Conclusion

Architecture and design are synergies of 

Architecture artifacts rest on collective development.


## Wrap up. Does it matter?

Not at all. Titles are like book covers. You don't care about it when getting to the contents.

And let's salt all this with a bitter reminder that most projects are CASTING domain concepts to known and tried architectural solutions with decent contributions. Many arch and design solutions are already solved in languages and platforms.
