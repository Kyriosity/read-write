# Driving Tests &mdash; Big Watershed
=> cold bath

I was bicycling to hear a casual lecture on [TD<mark>D</mark>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)<sup>🔗</sup> and doubt crept in &mdash; where am I going: 

> "Is that <mark><b>D</b></mark> not for **_Design_** but **_Development_**?" (It wasn't about the lecture but the principal divergence.)

Worried I retrospected popular TDD tutrials and revealed that the shadow of doubt was from THE MOUNTING RIDGE dividing dev and design. ]
What's next - it was one among others with the peaks named "domain", "design", "drives", and "tests". I've exploited this theme in DRIVES but here I'd like to share the thought...

Let's not get sidetracked for now.

> SPOILER❗**Write-first test coverage shall not drive design while design tests shall not cover functionality to develop.**\
<sub>This simple revelation struck me at a lecture on TDD when I realized that the last D is not for **D**esign but **D**evelopment.</sub>

> A software system can best be designed if the testing is interlaced with the designing instead of being used after the design.\
