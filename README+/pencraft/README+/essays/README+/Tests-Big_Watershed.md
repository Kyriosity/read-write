# Test Drive &mdash; Big Watershed

  </td><td><p>I was bicycling to hear a casual lecture on <b>TD<mark>D</mark></b> and the doubt crept in &mdash; where am I going: </p>
    <p></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must this <mark><b>D</b></mark> be for <b><i>Design</i></b> or <b><i>Development</i></b>❓</p>
It wasn't about the lecture, but the principal divergence.<br />
(For the record: the lecture regarded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development</a><sup>🔗</sup> as you might been convinced.)

Pretty worried I searched by <kbd>T D D</kbd> and fairly retrospected the found. Presentations and lectures favored _development_ with design as a natural<sup>🌵</sup> derivative, not much bothering about distinction and some even exploited both terms interchangeably. Books and tutorials also inclined more toward techniques, patterns, and testing frameworks.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🙋</sup> <sub>Albeit being energetic in the recherche I couldn't go through the best part of treatises. There must be the same findings, but better, and there could be better alternating visions.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🌵</sup> <sub>**Natural** since any complete snippet can't escape design or must fit into the given.</sub>

What was fine for presentations, bootcamps, and `classes` didn't work for me on just mediocre features (imaginary or tried): <ins>my test drive split up into **D**esign and **D**evelopment</ins>.

## Could I draw <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my shismatic take?

> These could be the same project and team, test tools/framework, and skills/techniques to write tests, but...\
>  **Design vs. Development are too dissimilar and exclusive to be driven together.**

<details><summary><ins>&nbsp;This shadow of doubt was from the rising ridge, dividing syntax and implementation behind it:&nbsp;</ins></summary>

### Test Driven Design T⚙️D<sup>eV</sup> 

"Design tests" must define **what** to develop (whether test-driven or not). 

+ grope concepts and get a hands-on feeling on subjects (be it bookkeeping routines or particles acceleration models),
+ vitalize skeleton functionality, evaluate trends and risks,
+ couple design fantasies with the tech-stack materiality.

RESULT: Syntax and API

Different LANG and FRAMEW !

### Test Driven Development vs T⚙️D<sup>eS</sup>

Use of test doubles is LIMITED

### OVERLAP ?

There's no room for compromise: implementation-first will result in an abstraction-poor _Code Driven Design_, which quality will degrade with complexity.


WHAT INTERCEPT's DOES NOT OVERLAP. WHAT COOPERATES do not DEPENDs


## Conclusion

What made matters worse &mdash; revealing that this ridge is among others on the design topology. This triggered the painful rewrite of much stuff, starting from ⚙️[drives](../../../../software/design/drive) **but** let's not get sidetracked for now.

  Tests are the first strokes of code. Maybe experimental or even alternatives in miscellaneous languages and frameworks/libraries.
