# Pen & Brush craft &mdash; Technical writing

[__Documentation__](README+/tech_docu.md)<sup>📄</sup> and [__authoring__](README+/tech-authoring.md)<sup>🖊️</sup> are two very diverging employments of writing and painting skills with opposed values of formalism, creativity, envisaging, and styles. Their principled distinction is __*driven*__ vs __*drives*__:

* <ins>Documentation</ins> is **on-demand/request** derivative of a product, must follow templates and shall be (auto-)generated and reused as much as possible.<sup>📖</sup>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>📖</sup> <sub>A strict _User manual_ of hazardous tools is an exemplary story.</sub>

* <ins>Authoring</ins> is **initiative**, must take a bird's view of the subject, inspire and explain sophisticated and regulated ideas in an abstractive, friendly, and sometimes informal/playful manner.

<ins>**Documentation**</ins> assumes defined, if not available, subjects (as software applications), while <ins>**authoring**</ins> may begin with a bare idea. (Enough technical oeuvres, such as concepts of relational DBs or REST, were based on "paper" concepts with little or no implementation.)

When it's often a reader's headache to find and study the right <ins>documentation</ins> in any state and grade, with <ins>authoring</ins>, it's a burden of "pensters" to attract the public. 

In documenting sticking to the narrowed vocabulary and cliches is a benefactor, in authoring repetition is a sin.

Regardless of missions, any tech writing is an expensive and exhausting exercise and, if not a hobby or bondage, must:

+ [x] have a live eager auditorium,
+ [x] exceed other ways of teaching (consider quickly sketched presentation, captured video tutorial, or watercooler talks),
+ [x] be long-term (updated and evolved).


## Side effects of pencraft/brush

Documenting/sketching ideas for even small features mitigates the impedance between the stretch of imagination and implementation reality. 
Namely, formalization and structuring compel us to reexplore and examine concepts, enhance good sides, and reject unrealistic or meaningless stuff. 

## Appendix. My disclaimer

The writings and collections here are ...

* The subject of personal taste, inclination, vision, and fallacies. (It's up to you whether to like them or recoil in distaste.)
* The subject of continuous delivery (i.e. endless edit and modification).
* Some opuses may be in the badly readable state of 🚧draft🐝 (skip them while I do my best to finish).
