The grains of truth in this wisdom:

* No other knowledge erodes so quickly as the IT tech stack - languages/scripts, markup, frameworks, and their IDEs, UX styles emerge, submerge, and mutate with the year's pace.<sup>:violin:</sup>
* In the orthogonal  (to time) dimension a developer can't stick to a favorite syntax and must be fluent in a wide techno spectrum.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:violin:</sup> <sub>Javascript/HTML, which one learned in 2000, remains only as basic syntax. It went through numerous libs, polyfills, jQuery, and other cool tools and at the moment transformed into single-page frameworks, which rule the web dev.</sub>

**Escape?**

> Don't swim against the current. Stay in the river, become the river; and the river is already going to the sea. This is the great teaching.\
— Rajneesh, aka Osho (1931-1990)

Translated east-to-west this means: find a sinecure in a big corporation.

Well, ability in exact sciences isn't a prerequisite for casual programming. You shouldn't develop a sorting algorithm since you may find any.

P.S. I do swear that concocting this collage I was unaware of _Hubert Dreyfus_'s "Alchemy and AI", 1965.
